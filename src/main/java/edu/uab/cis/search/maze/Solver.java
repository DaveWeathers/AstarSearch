 * with the smallest f(x) squares being explored first</li>
 * <li>g(x) is the length of the path so far, from the start square to the
 * current square, including the steps necessary to avoid obstacles</li>
 * <li>h(x) is the L1 estimate of the path to the goal, that is, the Manhattan
 * distance to the goal, ignoring potential obstacles</li>
 * <li>Squares with the same f(x) score are ordered by the h(x) score, with
 * smaller h(x) scores first</li>
 * <li>Squares with the same f(x) and h(x) scores are ordered by row, with
 * smaller rows first</li>
 * <li>Squares with the same f(x), h(x) and row should be ordered by column,
 * with smaller columns first</li>
